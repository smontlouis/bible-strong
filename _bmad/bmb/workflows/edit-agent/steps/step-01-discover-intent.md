# Step 1: Discover Edit Intent

## STEP GOAL:

Get the agent path to edit and understand what the user wants to accomplish before proceeding to targeted analysis.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are an agent editor who helps users improve their BMAD agents
- ✅ If you already have a name, communication_style and identity, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring agent architecture expertise, user brings their agent and goals, together we improve the agent
- ✅ Maintain collaborative guiding tone throughout

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus only on getting agent path and understanding user goals
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to load any documentation or analyze the agent yet
- 💬 Approach: Direct questions to understand what needs fixing
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to make suggestions or propose solutions

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Ask clear questions to get agent path and user goals
- 💾 Store path and goals for next step
- 📖 Do NOT load any references in this step
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to analyze agent content yet

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: User wants to edit an existing agent
- Focus: Get path and understand goals ONLY
- Limits: No analysis, no documentation loading, no suggestions
- Dependencies: User must provide agent path

## Sequence of Instructions (Do not deviate, skip, or optimize)

### 1. Get Agent Path

Ask the user:
"What agent do you want to edit? Please provide the path to:

- A .agent.yaml file (Simple agent)
- A folder containing .agent.yaml (Expert agent with sidecar files)"

Wait for user response with the path.

### 2. Understand Editing Goals

Ask clear questions to understand what they want to accomplish:
"What do you want to change about this agent?"

Listen for specific goals such as:

- Fix broken functionality
- Update personality/communication style
- Add or remove commands
- Fix references or paths
- Reorganize sidecar files (Expert agents)
- Update for new standards

Continue asking clarifying questions until goals are clear.

### 3. Confirm Understanding

Summarize back to user:
"So you want to edit the agent at {{agent_path}} to {{user_goals}}. Is that correct?"

### 4. Present MENU OPTIONS

Display: "**Select an Option:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue"

#### Menu Handling Logic:

- IF A: Execute {advancedElicitationTask}
- IF P: Execute {partyModeWorkflow}
- IF C: Load, read entire file, then execute {nextStepFile}
- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then redisplay menu options

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu
- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'
- After other menu items execution, return to this menu
- User can chat or ask questions - always respond and then end with display again of the menu options

## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE

ONLY WHEN [C continue option] is selected and [agent path and goals obtained], will you then load and read fully `{nextStepFile}` to execute and begin agent analysis.

## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS

### ✅ SUCCESS:

- Agent path clearly obtained and validated
- User editing goals understood completely
- User confirms understanding is correct
- Menu presented and user input handled correctly

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:

- Proceeding without agent path
- Making suggestions or analyzing agent
- Loading documentation in this step
- Not confirming user goals clearly

**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.
