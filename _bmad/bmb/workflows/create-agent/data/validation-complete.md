## Architecture Improvements

### ✅ Step-Specific Loading Optimization

**Legacy Architecture:**

- Single `instructions.md` file (~500 lines)
- All steps loaded into memory upfront
- No conditional loading based on agent type
- Linear execution regardless of context

**New Architecture:**

- 11 focused step files (50-150 lines each)
- Just-in-time loading of individual steps
- Conditional execution paths based on agent type
- Optimized memory usage and performance

**Benefits Achieved:**

- **Memory Efficiency:** Only load current step (~70% reduction)
- **Performance:** Faster step transitions
- **Maintainability:** Individual step files easier to edit
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add or modify steps

### ✅ Enhanced Template System

**Legacy:**

- Basic template references in XML
- Limited agent type differentiation
- Minimal customization options

**New:**

- Comprehensive templates for each agent type:
  - `agent-complete-simple.md` - Self-contained agents
  - `agent-complete-expert.md` - Learning agents with sidecar
  - `agent-complete-module.md` - Team coordination agents
- Detailed documentation and examples
- Advanced configuration options
