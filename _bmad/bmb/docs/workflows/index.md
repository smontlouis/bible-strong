# BMAD Workflows Documentation

Welcome to the BMAD Workflows documentation - a modern system for creating structured, collaborative workflows optimized for AI execution.

## 📚 Core Documentation

### [Terms](./terms.md)

Essential terminology and concepts for understanding BMAD workflows.

### [Architecture & Execution Model](./architecture.md)

The micro-file architecture, JIT step loading, state management, and collaboration patterns that make BMAD workflows optimal for AI execution.

### Writing Workflows _(TODO)_

Complete guide to creating workflows: workflow.md control files, step files, CSV data integration, and frontmatter design.

### Step Files & Dialog Patterns _(TODO)_

Crafting effective step files: structure, execution rules, prescriptive vs intent-based dialog, and validation patterns.

### Templates & Content Generation _(TODO)_

Creating append-only templates, frontmatter design, conditional content, and dynamic content generation strategies.

### Workflow Patterns _(TODO)_

Common workflow types: linear, conditional, protocol integration, multi-agent workflows, and real-world examples.

### Migration Guide _(TODO)_

Converting from XML-heavy workflows to the new pure markdown format, with before/after examples and checklist.

### Best Practices & Reference _(TODO)_

Critical rules, anti-patterns, performance optimization, debugging, quick reference templates, and troubleshooting.

## 🚀 Quick Start

BMAD workflows are pure markdown, self-contained systems that guide collaborative processes through structured step files where the AI acts as a facilitator working with humans.
